# Welcome to mbedStudio!

Here is what you need to know.

1. This IDE is open source, you can contribute to it on [GitHub](https://github.com/code-box/codebox).

2. If you only remember one thing make it `cmd-shift-P` (or `ctrl-shift-P` on Windows and Linux). This keystroke toggles
   the command palette, which lists every command.
